this Jupyter notebook developed for The Learning Agency Lab - Automated Essay Scoring 2.0 . This notebook is designed to help you participate in the competition and to Develop automated techniques to improve upon essay scoring algorithms to improve student learning outcomes.\n\n\n\n### Inspiration and Credits 🙌\nThis notebook is inspired by the work of SiddhVR, available at [this Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/siddhvr/aes-2-0-deberta-lgbm-baseline). I extend my gratitude to SiddhVR for sharing their insights and code publicly.\n\n\n**Model Components:**\n\n1. **Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM):** LGBM is a powerful gradient boosting framework that efficiently handles large datasets and provides high accuracy. It is employed as the primary machine learning algorithm in our model for essay scoring.\n\n2. **Deberta Transformer Embeddings:** Deberta is a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model. We utilize Deberta embeddings to capture rich semantic information from essays, enhancing the model's understanding of the text.\n\n3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization is utilized to convert text into numerical representations while considering the importance of words in essays. It helps in capturing the significance of words and phrases in the scoring process.\n\n4. **CountVectorizer:** CountVectorizer is used to convert text into a matrix of token counts. It enables us to extract features based on word frequencies, which contribute to the overall scoring mechanism.\n\n5. **Ensemble Learning:** Our model employs ensemble learning techniques, combining predictions from multiple models to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the scoring process.\n\n**🌟 Explore my profile and other public projects, and don't forget to share your feedback!**\n\n## 👉 [Visit my Profile]( https://www.kaggle.com/code/zulqarnainalipk) 👈\n\n\n**Working of the Model:**\n\n1. **Data Preprocessing:** The essay text undergoes preprocessing steps, including lowercasing, HTML tag removal, punctuation removal, spelling error detection, and contraction expansion.\n\n2. **Feature Engineering:** Features are extracted from the preprocessed text, including paragraph length, sentence count, word count, and other linguistic features.\n\n3. **Model Training:** The preprocessed features are fed into the LGBM model along with Deberta embeddings, TF-IDF vectors, and CountVectorizer representations. The model is trained using a combination of these features to learn the scoring patterns.\n\n4. **Cross-Validation:** The model undergoes cross-validation using stratified k-fold technique to ensure robustness and reliability in scoring.\n\n5. **Ensemble Prediction:** Predictions from multiple models trained on different folds are averaged to obtain the final predicted scores for the essays.\n\n6. **Submission Generation:** The predicted scores are then used to generate a submission file in CSV format, which can be used for evaluation or submission in essay scoring competitions.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments 🙏\nI acknowledge The Learning Agency Lab organizers for providing the dataset and the competition platform.\n\nLet's get started!

Here's a breakdown of the function:\n\n- **Feature Selection Process:**\n  - The function starts by defining a list of features to be considered for selection, obtained from the `feature_names` variable.\n  - It initializes a Series `fse` with zeros as the index, where each index corresponds to a feature name.\n\n- **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation:**\n  - The function uses Stratified K-Fold cross-validation (`StratifiedKFold`) with 5 folds (`n_splits=5`). This ensures that class distributions are approximately equal in each fold.\n  - Within each fold, the training data is split into train and test sets (`X_train_fold`, `X_test_fold`, `y_train_fold`, `y_test_fold`, `y_test_fold_int`) using the indices generated by `skf.split`.\n  - A LightGBM regression model is instantiated (`lgb.LGBMRegressor`) with specified hyperparameters for regression.\n  - The model is trained on the training data (`X_train_fold`, `y_train_fold`) and evaluated on both the training and validation sets (`eval_set`), using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa as the evaluation metric (`eval_metric=quadratic_weighted_kappa`).\n  - The model's predictions on the test set (`X_test_fold`) are computed and rounded to the nearest integer within the range [1, 6].\n  - Performance metrics such as F1 score (`f1_fold`) and Cohen's kappa score (`kappa_fold`) are computed and printed for each fold.\n  - Additionally, a confusion matrix (`cm`) is generated and displayed for visual inspection of model performance.\n\n- **Feature Importance Calculation:**\n  - Feature importance scores (`predictor.feature_importances_`) from each fold are aggregated in the `fse` Series, where each score is added to the corresponding feature's entry.\n  - After processing all folds, the feature importance scores in `fse` are sorted in descending order, and the top 13,000 features are selected (`feature_select`).\n\n- **Return Value:**\n  - The function returns the list of selected features (`feature_select`).\n\nWe create a function to allows for iterative feature selection based on the importance scores generated by LightGBM models trained in a cross-validation framework. By evaluating model performance and feature importance across multiple folds, it provides a  method for selecting informative features.

The adjusted predictions from all models are stored in the `probabilities` list.\n  \n- **Aggregating Predictions:**\n  - The predictions from all models are averaged element-wise to obtain the final prediction probabilities for each sample in the test data.\n  \n- **Rounding Predictions:**\n  - The averaged probabilities are rounded to the nearest integer value to get the final predicted scores.\n  - Predicted scores below 1 are clipped to 1, and scores above 6 are clipped to 6 to ensure they fall within the valid scoring range.\n  \n- **Displaying Predictions:**\n  - The final predictions are printed to the console.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"probabilities = []\nfor model in models:\n    proba= model.predict(test_feats[feature_select])+ a\n    probabilities.append(proba)\n\npredictions = np.mean(probabilities, axis=0)\n\npredictions = np.round(predictions.clip(1, 6))\n\nprint(predictions)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.166837Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.166549Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.929946Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.928932Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.814368,"end_time":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.932296","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.117928","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission=pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/learning-agency-lab-automated-essay-scoring-2/sample_submission.csv\")\nsubmission['score']=predictions\nsubmission['score']=submission['score'].astype(int)\nsubmission.to_csv(\"submission.csv\",index=None)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-21T19:30:36.031965Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-21T19:30:36.031247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-21T19:30:36.060924Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-21T19:30:36.060053Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.08022,"end_time":"2024-04-21T19:30:36.062814","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-21T19:30:35.982594","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Keep Exploring! 👀\n\nThank you for delving into this notebook!
